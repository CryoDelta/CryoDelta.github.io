# Portfolio
E-portfolio made to showcase my favorite works for year 2023/2024.

## List of projects
- [Magicdle](#magicdle)
- [Gasc](#gasc)
- [ThreeJs Explorer](#threejs-explorer)

## Magicdle
### Project pitch
Magidle takes the idea of the famous word game Wordle and translates and expands it to find Magic the Gathering cards instead of words. It also comes with a card database navigator to make the guesses easier to make.
### Specificities
Magicdle uses Symfony for the structure & Bootstrap for the frontend. It was made in around a month but only during allowed time spans when at the uni so the real time is more around 24 to 32 hours of work.
### Contribution
Magidle was a duo project, me and a friend and we both worked on multiple aspects of the website. The specific part I worked on are all the visuals, the search filters and the card import script.

## Gasc
### Project pitch
Our uni uses a proprietary website to allow students to subscribe to sports and cultural activities. This website was clunky so we were asked to upgrade it to meet higher standards and also add a few features.
### Specificities
Gasc uses Symfony for the structure & Bootstrap for the frontend. It was our semester's big project so we worked on it for 6 months. We decided that it was better to fully remake it so the project workload ended up to be more inportant than what we could provide but the project is still around 80 to 90% completed.
### Contribution
Gasc was a trio project, me and a two classmates and we divided work by functionnalities. My proudest achievement on this project is the chat functionnality that I worked on as I did 100% of it, from the back to the front.

## ThreeJs Explorer
### Project pitch
This was a class project created to prove my overall understanding of the ThreeJs technology. The project requirements were purely technical so I had freedom in term of pure content.
### Specificities
ThreeJs Explorer uses the JavaScript 3D library ThreeJs that allows for 3d in web apps. It was a small project of 8 hours and had to be done in class.
### Contribution
ThreeJs Explorer is a solo project so I did everything on this one.
